                    <p>Our adult learn to sail program uses our fleet of 420
                        dinghies to provide you with an exciting sailing
                        opportunity! With our experienced CANSail instructors
                        helping you along, dinghy sailing is a great way to learn
                        to sail. Sailing on a dinghy gives you the chance to be
                        active and hands-on with everything happening on the boat.
                        The boat is small, easy to handle and can provide an
                        exciting sailing experience, but that also means you may
                        get a little wet!
