            <h1>General Program Information</h1>
            <h2>Sailing School Location</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All courses/sessions are conducted at the South Port
                    Sailing Club, 210 Brighton Road, Tecumseh Ontario
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All instructors at South Port Sailing School are trained
                    and certified by both Sail Canada and Ontario Sailing
                    Associations.
                </li>
                <li>South Port is proud to be the home club to several
                    members of the Ontario Sailing Team, and encourages our
                    sailors and instructors to compete at the highest levels.
                </li>
                <li>During a course, certified instructors may be accompanied
                    by Instructor in Training, or "IITs". These are qualified
                    sailors from around Windsor-Essex working toward their
                    teaching certifications and contribute their time, effort
                    and experience to assist the sailors and the instructors
                    when possible.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safety Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each sailor must have his or her own approved vest type
                    lifejacket. This will be worn at all times when on the water.
                    Note that lifejackets must be approved by either Transport
                    Canada, Canadian Coast Guard, or Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
                </li>
                <li>Sailing is an active pastime. Each sailor must be able to swim
                    a minimum of 50 feet within a reasonable time.
                </li>
                <li>Each sailor must be able to swim underwater.
                    <br>(Note that sailors may be tested to ensure they meet above
                    swimming requirements.)
                </li>
                <li>Each sailor is requested to dress for the weather, considering
                    both temperatures (hypothermia) and sun (UV) for any given day.
                    Sailors should also bring sunscreen as necessary for their own
                    use.
                </li>
                <li>Sailors must bring proper footwear that can be worn on a boat
                    and in the water.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Course Dates</h2>
            <p>The duration of our courses are from the beginning of July to the end
                of August of this year (2024). Please visit our registration website
                listed below for more information.</p>

            <p>Registration for all programs can be made using our online registration
                system, <a href="https://southportsailingclub.checklick.com">https://southportsailingclub.checklick.com</a>. If a session has
                no spaces available, you can register on the waitlist. Any openings
                will be filled by those on the waitlist. Payment is due in full at the
                time of registration. All payments are made during registration with a
                credit card. A $50 administration fee will be deducted from the refund
                for any cancellations prior to the start of a session. No refunds will
                be issued once a session has started unless that space can be filled
                from the waitlist.

                    <p>
                        Each sailor must bring their own refillable water bottle, with their name
                        indelibly marked. Disposable water bottles will not be allowed. A means
                        of clipping the bottle to a boat is preferred if sailing in a dinghy.
                        <br><br>
                        Lunches should also be "garbage-free", and packed in reusable containers
                        with their name indelibly marked.<br>
                        (refer to <a href="www.sailorsforthesea.org">www.sailorsforthesea.org</a>)
                        <br><br>
                        Valuables should not be brought to class (ie: phones, cameras, watches,
                        jewellery). These items can be too easily dropped overboard or damaged
                        by the water. Also, SPSS cannot be held responsible for valuables left
                        unattended in the buildings or on the dock during a class.
                        <br><br>
                        Sailing lessons are a chance to enjoy the outdoors and spend time learning
                        new skills and meeting new friends. The staff request that students refrain
                        from using any electronic device during class time. Please leave devices at
                        home or in your bags while at South Port.

                    <p>
                        CANSail Levels were introduced in 2012. Full details are available at the
                        Sail Canada website. Levels are accomplished when a skill level is achieved.
                        Everyone learns at their own pace, and weather can play a big role. Our
                        instructors stress fun over achievement for young children. If level
                        achievement is important, tell your instructor and they will give you
                        progress reports.

                    <h2>Advancing Sailors: Questions and Concerns</h2>
                    <p>
                        SPSC Sailing School has set a high standard of achievement for its
                        sailors to insure they move through the levels with confidence and the
                        required base skills. Many of the instructors frequently required repeated
                        levels to meet the program requirements.
                        <br><br>
                        In the past, instructors have felt parental pressure to advance sailors who
                        had not achieved the required competence to advance. Obviously this would
                        create serious concerns if, while in advanced levels, the sailor was unable
                        to demonstrate the required skills â€” especially when some were necessary to
                        sail independently on the Great Lakes.
                        <br><br>
                        Please accept and appreciate that not all sailors will achieve the required
                        skills on the first attempt. It is our goal to insure sailors can demonstrate
                        consistently the required skills of the level being undertaken â€” a sailor
                        that does not consistently demonstrate the required skills does not fail â€”
                        the sailor has simply not completed the level. Please contact your child's
                        instructor if you have concerns about your child's advancement. In most cases
                        extra help can be arranged if you wish.
